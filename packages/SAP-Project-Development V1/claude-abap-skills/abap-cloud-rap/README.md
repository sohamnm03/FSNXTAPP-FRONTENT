# `abap-cloud-rap` plugin

ABAP Cloud / RAP rules and three skills for Claude Code. One of two plugins in the [claude-abap-skills](../README.md) repo (the other is [`clean-abap`](../clean-abap/README.md) — independent).

```bash
claude plugin install abap-cloud-rap@claude-abap-skills
```

Independent from the [`clean-abap`](../clean-abap/README.md) plugin — install both for full coverage, but neither loads the other at runtime.

## What this plugin gives you

- **15 ABAP Cloud / RAP rules** in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), covering clean core (released APIs, no SAP-owned table reads, ABAP Cloud language scope, no SAP-standard modification), RAP behavior design (managed vs unmanaged, semantic key, draft handling, determinations/validations/side effects, action design, feature control), CDS layering (interface → projection → consumption, required annotations, no business logic in projections, composition vs association), and testing (ABAP Unit with CDS test doubles). Each rule has concrete CDS/BDEF/ABAP examples and the related ATC checks. Where BTP and S/4HANA on-prem differ, the rule calls it out.
- **Three skills** invokable in any Claude Code session once installed:

| Skill | Invoke when |
|-------|-------------|
| **`/abap-cloud-rap:rap-bo-design`** | The user asks to design, scaffold, generate, or create a new RAP BO, OData service, or Fiori UI service. Prefers the official SAP ADT MCP's `x-ui-service` / `ui-service` / `webapi-service` generators (creates the persistent table, draft table, CDS layers, BDEFs, behavior pool, access control, service def/binding, metadata extension in one call); falls back to hand-crafted CDS/BDEF skeletons when no generator fits. |
| **`/abap-cloud-rap:atc-remediation`** | The user asks to fix, remediate, address, or triage ATC findings on an object, package, or transport. Groups findings by category, proposes a concrete fix per finding, refuses pseudo-comment suppressions by default. |
| **`/abap-cloud-rap:clean-core-check`** | The user asks to audit clean core compliance, ABAP Cloud compatibility, released-API usage, or extension-point usage. Read-only. Distinguishes hard violations (never allowed in either system) from soft warnings (transitional in S/4HANA on-prem, hard in BTP). |

## Scope — targets and out-of-scope

- **Supported:** SAP BTP ABAP Environment, SAP S/4HANA on-prem in the ABAP Cloud development model
- **Not supported:** SAP ECC, classic (non-Cloud) development model, classic dynpro / SUBMIT / FORM / unreleased FMs / direct SAP-table SELECTs

This plugin **enforces** clean core. It will not generate code that violates it. PRs adding content for unsupported scopes will be closed — see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Token cost

Run `claude plugin details abap-cloud-rap` to see live numbers. As of v0.2.2:

| Layer | Cost |
|-------|------|
| Always-on (skill descriptions) | ~491 tok |
| `/abap-cloud-rap:rap-bo-design` on-invoke | ~3.5k tok |
| `/abap-cloud-rap:atc-remediation` on-invoke | ~1.5k tok |
| `/abap-cloud-rap:clean-core-check` on-invoke | ~1.6k tok |

The 15-rule CLAUDE.md (~26 KB) is **not** always-on — each skill reads it explicitly when invoked.

## MCP capability note

These skills route **per capability**, not per server. The full routing table lives in this plugin's `CLAUDE.md` under `## Tooling`, and each SKILL.md repeats the slice it needs. The short version:

- **Official `SAPSE.adt-vscode` MCP** — everything that changes the system (`abap_creation-*`, `abap_generators-*`, `abap_activate_objects`, `abap_transport-*`), plus **ATC** (`abap_atc_run` / `abap_atc_get_result`) and its quick-fix tools. This is what `rap-bo-design` drives end-to-end.
- **A read-capable MCP such as [ARC-1](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1)** — object source reads, repository search, package listing, dependency/impact analysis, API release state (`SAPRead type=API_STATE`), ATC variant discovery. The official server exposes none of these, so `clean-core-check` and the post-generation review in `rap-bo-design` depend on it for live (rather than pasted) input. It also backstops ATC via `SAPDiagnose action="atc"` when the official server's session has expired, and — where its write scope is enabled — backstops object creation and activation too. The RAP **generators** have no fallback: only the official server ships them.
- **Neither connected** — every skill still runs on pasted source and pasted ATC output. None of them will fabricate findings.

See the top-level [README — Tool routing](../README.md#tool-routing--official-mcp-first-arc-1-as-fallback).

### `MCP_TIMEOUT`

The RAP generators routinely take 60–180 s for a multi-entity BO; Claude Code's default MCP tool timeout (~30 s) is shorter. Launch Claude Code with `MCP_TIMEOUT=600000` (10 min) when running `/abap-cloud-rap:rap-bo-design`, or the tool call will report a false timeout while the server keeps generating in the background.
