# abap-cloud-rap:rap-bo-design

Design a new RAP business object end-to-end and create it via the SAP ABAP MCP Server.

## What this command does

You are designing a complete RAP business object from a short spec, then creating it in the connected ABAP system. The official ADT MCP Server (in `SAPSE.adt-vscode`) exposes three RAP **generators** that bootstrap a conformant stack in one call â€” that is the primary path. You then validate the generated stack against the rules in `.github/instructions/abap-cloud-rap.instructions.md` and refine it.

The "hand-crafted skeleton" path is a **fallback** for cases the generators do not fit.

**Tool routing.** Read the `## Tooling` section in `.github/instructions/abap-cloud-rap.instructions.md` before the first tool call. This skill is write-heavy, so the official server owns nearly all of it:

| Step | Primary | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Generate a full RAP stack in one call | `abap-adt` `abap_generators-*` | none â€” no other server has the generators |
| Create individual objects, activate, transports | `abap-adt` `abap_creation-*`, `abap_activate_objects`, `abap_transport-*` | `arc-1` `SAPWrite` + `SAPActivate` when write scope is enabled (`SAPManage action="create_package"` for the package; syntax-check each artifact with `SAPDiagnose action="syntax"` before writing) |
| Confirm the target package exists / inspect it | `arc-1` `SAPRead type=DEVC` | proceed and let creation fail loudly |
| **Read back the generated source for the post-generation review** | `arc-1` `SAPRead` (`type=DDLS` / `BDEF` / `SRVD` / `CLAS`) | inspect the generation response only, and mark every review row *not verified* |
| Verify the generated stack activates cleanly | `abap-adt` `abap_activate_objects` result | `arc-1` `SAPDiagnose action="syntax"` |
| Service binding / OData check | `abap-adt` `abap_business_services-fetch_service_information` | `arc-1` `SAPRead type=SRVB` |

The post-generation review below is only meaningful when you can **read the generated source**. Without `arc-1` (or another read path), you are reviewing a response payload, not code â€” say so instead of ticking boxes.

## Inputs to collect

Before doing anything, confirm or ask for each of the following. If anything is ambiguous, ask â€” do not silently pick a default. Bundle the questions in one short turn rather than multi-turn interrogation.

1. **Project name** â€” short label that becomes the SAP Object Type / Service Definition / Service Binding name (max 24 chars). E.g. `Flight`, `Travel`, `WorkOrder`.
2. **Artifact prefix and suffix** â€” used for the generated CDS / BDEF / table names. E.g. prefix `Z` â†’ `ZR_Flight`, `ZI_Flight`, `ZFlight` table.
3. **Application type** â€” `readOnly`, `withDraft`, or `withoutDraft` (transactional). `withDraft` is the default for editable BOs.
4. **Entities** â€” for each entity:
   - Entity alias (e.g. `Flight`)
   - Composition parent (if a child entity) and cardinality (`toOne` / `toMany`)
   - Field list with:
     - field name
     - data type (`uuid`, `char`, `numc`, `integer`, `decimal`, `date`, `timestamp`, `amount`, `currencyCode`, `quantity`, `unitOfMeasure`, `string`, `boolean`)
     - whether it is a **semantic key** (the human-readable business identifier â€” required per `semantic-key-alongside-technical-uuid`)
     - length / decimals where relevant
     - linked currency / unit field for amounts and quantities
5. **Package** â€” a real `ZFS*` package. This workspace has no local/temporary tier: every object needs a package and a transport request (L-215).
6. **Target system** â€” BTP ABAP Environment, or S/4HANA on-prem in ABAP Cloud development model. Released-API sets differ.

## Procedure

### Step 1 â€” pick the generation path

Decision tree, in order:

| Situation                                       | Path                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| New BO, no existing persistent table            | **`x-ui-service` generator** â€” creates persistent table, draft table, CDS interface, projection, BDEF, projection BDEF, behavior pool, access control, service definition, service binding, metadata extension |
| New BO, persistent table already exists         | **`ui-service` generator** â€” reuses the table, generates the rest of the UI stack |
| New BO, Web API only (no Fiori UI)              | **`webapi-service` generator** â€” reuses table, generates Web API stack only   |
| Pattern outside the generators (e.g. heterogeneous compositions, non-CDS sources, abstract entities) | **Hand-crafted fallback** â€” see Step 5 |

Call `mcp__abap-adt__abap_generators-list_generators` once if you want to confirm the available IDs in this system.

### Step 2 â€” fetch the schema and build the spec

Call `mcp__abap-adt__abap_generators-get_schema` for the chosen generator. The schema returns a `referenceContent` block with a `sessionId` â€” **use that sessionId verbatim** in the spec you submit. Then build the JSON spec:

- `metadata.package` â€” the chosen package
- `serviceConfiguration.serviceNaming.projectName` â€” the project name
- `serviceConfiguration.objectsNaming.prefix` / `.suffix` â€” for generated artifact names
- `serviceConfiguration.applicationType` â€” `readOnly` / `withDraft` / `withoutDraft`
- `businessEntities` â€” one entry per entity, with `entityName`, `compositionParent` (if a child), `compositionCardinality`
- `businessEntitiesFields` â€” one entry per entity, with the field list

Apply the rules in `CLAUDE.md` while building the spec:
- **`semantic-key-alongside-technical-uuid`** â€” at least one field per entity must have `isSemanticKey: true`. The generator adds the technical UUID key automatically.
- **`composition-for-children-association-for-references`** â€” declare child entities with `compositionCardinality` `toOne` or `toMany`; reference data goes via associations in the post-generation refinement, not as composition.
- For amounts and quantities â€” link `currencyCode` / `unitOfMeasure` to the appropriate currency or UoM field on the same entity.

### Step 3 â€” request a transport (if needed)

Call `mcp__abap-adt__abap_transport-get` for the package (objectType `DEVC/K`, `isCreation: true`). **Ask the user** to pick an existing transport or create a new one â€” never auto-select. A transport is always required here.

### Step 4 â€” generate, activate, verify

**Precondition â€” MCP client timeout.** Claude Code's default MCP tool timeout (~30 s) is shorter than a full `x-ui-service` run, which routinely takes 60â€“180 s for a multi-entity BO. The tool call will return "operation timed out" while the MCP server keeps generating in the background. **Before running this step**, ask the user to launch Claude Code with `MCP_TIMEOUT=600000` (10 min). If they cannot restart, proceed anyway â€” the server will finish â€” and use the recovery path below to discover what was created.

1. Call `mcp__abap-adt__abap_generators-generate_objects` with the spec from Step 2 and the transport from Step 3.
2. Collect the URIs and names of the generated objects from the response. **The response is the only authoritative source for actual names** â€” see naming caveat below.
3. Call `mcp__abap-adt__abap_activate_objects` with those URIs.
4. Run the **post-generation review** below.

**Naming caveat â€” names are not deterministic from the spec.** The generator inserts auto-namespace fragments that are not present in the input spec. Observed pattern: with `prefix: "Z"` and `projectName: "Flight"`, the consumption entity surfaced as `ZC_01FLIGHT` (note the `_01`), the service binding as `ZUI_FLIGHT_O4`. Do not predict names from the spec â€” use the response. If the response was lost (e.g. client-side timeout), recover in this order: (1) `arc-1` `SAPRead type=DEVC` on the target package â€” it lists everything the generator actually created, with real names and URIs; (2) `arc-1` `SAPSearch` for the naming pattern; (3) `mcp__abap-adt__abap_business_services-fetch_services` with the most likely service binding name (`Z<prefix>UI_<PROJECTNAME>_O4` for V4 UI services), where a successful response confirms generation succeeded and surfaces the entity-set names.

### Step 5 â€” fallback (hand-crafted skeletons)

Only when no generator fits. Emit:
- Interface entity (`ZI_<Entity>`) â€” `define view entity`, every annotation per `interface-entity-required-annotations`
- Projection entity (`ZR_<Entity>`) â€” `provider contract transactional_query`, redirected compositions only, no business logic
- Consumption entity (`ZC_<Entity>`) â€” UI annotations live here
- BDEF â€” `managed implementation in class zbp_<root> unique; strict ( 2 ); with draft;` if drafts
- Behavior pool class â€” one per entity, `FINAL`, `PRIVATE`-constructor, local handler classes for validations / determinations / actions

Each is then created via `mcp__abap-adt__abap_creation-create_object` after `abap_creation-run_validation`. If the official server is unavailable and `arc-1` `SAPWrite` is enabled, write them there instead â€” writing the stack in dependency order, then `SAPActivate`, then confirm `SAPRead type=INACTIVE_OBJECTS` is clear. **Do not treat a per-artifact syntax check as a gate here**: writing a RAP stack means intermediate states that legitimately do not compile (a BDEF before its behavior pool, a projection before its interface view), which is exactly why `arc-1`'s server-side pre-write check is advisory. Activation is the gate. A hand-crafted stack left half-activated is worse than no stack.

## Post-generation review

Apply the rules from `CLAUDE.md` to whatever the generator produced. The generator emits a conformant skeleton, but the rules are stricter than the defaults.

**Read the generated source first** â€” `arc-1` `SAPRead` on the BDEF, the interface and projection DDLS, and the behavior pool class. Every check below is a claim about source you have actually seen. If you could not read it, mark the row *not verified* rather than âœ“.

Check, in order:

1. **BDEF `strict ( 2 );`** â€” required for new behaviors. Add if missing.
2. **`@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #CHECK`** on every interface entity. Add if missing.
3. **Semantic key fields** â€” confirm the right fields are marked as semantic keys; technical UUID is not the semantic key.
4. **Composition vs association** â€” confirm compositions are used for parent-owned children only; references to other BOs (e.g. Customer, Product) should be associations to released CDS view entities, not compositions or direct table joins.
5. **No business logic in the projection layer** â€” projections should be pure structural mapping per `projection-views-contain-no-business-logic`.
6. **Determinations / validations / side effects separation** â€” the generator does not add these; you do, per `separate-determinations-validations-and-side-effects`.
7. **Test class missing** â€” the generator does **not** create ABAP Unit tests. Add a local test class per behavior implementation, using `cl_cds_test_environment`, per `every-behavior-class-has-abap-unit-with-cds-test-doubles`.

Flag every gap in the output report. Do not silently fix issues that change semantics.

3. Preview the service binding to confirm the UI renders.
```

## Hard rules for this command

- **Use the generator when one fits.** A hand-crafted skeleton is the fallback, not the default.
- **Always include `sessionId`** from the schema response in the generation spec â€” verbatim.
- **Set `MCP_TIMEOUT=600000` (10 min) before launching Claude Code** when generation is on the plan. A 30 s client timeout against a 2 min server operation looks like a failure but is not.
- **Names come from the generation response, not the spec.** The generator adds suffixes (`_01`) and infixes (`UI`) that are not in the input. If the response is missing, recover via `fetch_services` with the conventional binding name pattern, never invent names downstream.
- **Apply every rule from this plugin's `CLAUDE.md`** in the post-generation review.
- **Always emit a semantic key field** for every entity, regardless of whether the spec explicitly mentioned it.
- **Always include `strict ( 2 );` in the BDEF** â€” add it post-generation if missing.
- **Never propose `unmanaged` for a new BO on new tables.** The generators do not even offer it.
- **Ask before requesting a transport.** Never auto-select an existing TR; never auto-create one.
- **Call out BTP vs S/4HANA on-prem differences** wherever they affect the design (released APIs, annotations).
- **Tests are always TODO.** The generator never emits them; the post-generation review always flags this.
