# clean-abap:refactor

Refactor existing ABAP code to conform to the Clean ABAP rule set in `.github/instructions/clean-abap.instructions.md` (relative to this skill's directory).

## What this command does

You are refactoring ABAP source code to bring it into compliance with the Clean ABAP rule set. **Style and structure only â€” business logic stays identical.** If a change would alter what the code does, you do not make it; you flag it instead.

## Inputs

Accept any of the following. If nothing is provided, ask which target the user wants.

- An ABAP object name â€” read it with `arc-1` `SAPRead`
- A package name â€” enumerate with `arc-1` `SAPRead type=DEVC`, then refactor object by object, never as a single bulk change
- A code block pasted into the conversation â€” always works, and is the only path when no read-capable server is connected

**Tool routing.** Read the `## Tooling` section in `.github/instructions/clean-abap.instructions.md` before the first tool call. The two halves of this skill land on different servers:

| Step | Primary | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Read the source | `arc-1` `SAPRead` | ask the user to paste it |
| Find callers before touching a signature | `arc-1` `SAPNavigate action="references"` | ask the user; if unknown, skip the change |
| Dry-run the refactored source | `arc-1` `SAPDiagnose action="syntax"` with `source` â€” validates without writing | skip, and rely on activation |
| Write back and activate | `abap-adt` `abap_creation-create_object`, `abap_activate_objects` | `arc-1` `SAPWrite` + `SAPActivate` when write scope is enabled; otherwise hand the diff to the user to paste in ADT |
| Prove behaviour is preserved | `abap-adt` `abap_run_unit_tests` | `arc-1` `SAPDiagnose action="unittest"` |

If only `arc-1` is connected, check whether its write actions are actually enabled before promising a write-back â€” when write scope is off, the mutating actions are absent from the tool's `action` enum. If they are absent, the refactor is **read-only**: produce the diff and hand it to the user. If they are present, write through `arc-1`, then **read the object back with `SAPRead` and confirm it matches the diff you showed**, and run `SAPActivate`. A successful `SAPWrite` means abaplint passed, not that the object compiles â€” activation is the real gate.

## Procedure

1. **Load the rule set.** Read every `## RULE:` block in `.github/instructions/clean-abap.instructions.md`. Those are the only refactoring targets.
2. **Get the source.** If pasted inline, use it. If an object name was given, read it with `arc-1` `SAPRead`. If no read-capable server is connected, ask the user to paste it from ADT.
3. **Run the review first.** Internally, perform the same analysis as `/clean-abap:review`. Use the prioritised list as your refactor plan.
4. **Refactor in passes**, in this order. Do not skip ahead:
   1. **Naming pass** â€” apply `use-problem-domain-names`, `no-magic-numbers-or-literals`
   2. **Declaration pass** â€” apply `prefer-inline-declarations`, `no-default-key-on-internal-tables`
   3. **Expression pass** â€” apply `use-string-templates-not-concatenate`, `prefer-is-not-initial-over-negation`, `prefer-case-over-long-if-elseif`, `use-table-expressions-not-read-table-plus-sy-subrc`
   4. **Method shape pass** â€” apply `methods-do-one-thing-and-stay-small`, `at-most-three-importing-parameters`, `prefer-returning-over-exporting`
   5. **Error pass** â€” apply `class-based-exceptions-not-sy-subrc`, `catch-specific-exceptions-not-cx-root`
   6. **Class shape pass** â€” apply `final-classes-and-private-members-by-default`, `prefer-new-over-create-object`
5. **Preserve behaviour.** After every pass, mentally diff the program logic. If you cannot prove a change is behaviour-preserving (e.g. a refactor would change exception types caught upstream, would change SELECT result order, would alter authority checks), **stop and ask** instead of guessing.
6. **Show the diff before writing back.** Produce a per-method or per-section before/after diff. Annotate every change with the rule name that motivated it. Syntax-check the result first with `arc-1` `SAPDiagnose action="syntax"` (passing `source`) â€” it validates the new source without writing anything, so a broken refactor never reaches the system.
7. **Ask for confirmation before writing back.** Explicit confirmation per object â€” not a blanket yes for a package. Write via the official `abap-adt` server (or `arc-1` `SAPWrite` if that is the only one enabled), then activate and confirm the object activated cleanly. When writing through `arc-1`, read the object back afterwards and confirm it matches the diff you showed.
8. **Re-run the object's ABAP Unit tests after activation** (`abap-adt` `abap_run_unit_tests`, fallback `arc-1` `SAPDiagnose action="unittest"`). A behaviour-preserving refactor with no test evidence is a claim, not a proof â€” if the object has no tests, say so in the report.

## Behaviour preservation â€” non-negotiable

These changes are out of scope for this command â€” they alter behaviour:

- Changing exception classes raised by a public method (callers catch them)
- Changing the order or set of database rows returned by a SELECT
- Removing authority checks, even if they look redundant
- Inlining or extracting code that crosses a `COMMIT WORK` / `ROLLBACK WORK`
- Changing the public signature of a method except `EXPORTING â†’ RETURNING` for a single output where no caller relies on `IS SUPPLIED`

If a Clean ABAP rule appears to require one of the above, **flag it** in the report and skip the change. Behaviour change belongs in a separate task, not in a style refactor.

## Output format

```
# Clean ABAP Refactor â€” <OBJECT NAME>

## Plan
1. <rule-name> â€” <count> occurrences
2. <rule-name> â€” <count> occurrences
...

## Changes

### <method or section name>

**Rule:** <rule-name>
**Before:**
` ` `abap
<original>
` ` `
**After:**
` ` `abap
<refactored>
` ` `
**Rationale:** <one sentence, no longer>

(repeat per change)

## Behaviour-preserving check
- [ ] No public method signature changed (except EXPORTINGâ†’RETURNING for single output)
- [ ] No exception classes added or removed from public methods
- [ ] No SELECTs reordered or filtered differently
- [ ] No authority checks removed
- [ ] No statements moved across COMMIT/ROLLBACK boundaries

## Skipped
<rule-name> at <location> â€” <one-line reason it would have changed behaviour>

## Verification
- Syntax check (arc-1 SAPDiagnose): pass / fail / not run
- ABAP Unit after activation: N passed, N failed / object has no tests / not run

## Confirmation
Write these changes back to <OBJECT NAME> via <abap-adt | arc-1>? (yes / no / per-method)
```

## Hard rules for this command

- **Style and structure only.** Never change what the code does.
- **One object at a time.** No silent batching across a package.
- **Confirm before write-back.** Always. Even if the user said yes for a previous object.
- **Activate after writing.** If activation fails, report the error and revert the write. Do not patch through activation errors.
- **No rule-by-rule chatter.** Group changes by method or section; one diff per change.
- **If a Clean ABAP rule conflicts with the ABAP Cloud / RAP overlay, the overlay wins.** Apply the overlay version of the rule. Note the conflict in the report.
