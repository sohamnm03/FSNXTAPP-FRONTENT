# abap-cloud-rap:clean-core-check

Check an ABAP object or package for clean core compliance. Pulls the source from the connected system and produces a categorised compliance report with concrete remediation steps.

## What this command does

You are auditing one or more ABAP objects for compliance with the **clean core** principles enforced by ABAP Cloud development model. The rules in `.github/instructions/abap-cloud-rap.instructions.md` define what is allowed; this command finds what is not. Output is a structured report â€” **read-only**, no writes back.

**Tool routing.** Read the `## Tooling` section in `.github/instructions/abap-cloud-rap.instructions.md` before the first tool call. This skill is read-heavy, so most of its work lands on `arc-1`:

| Step | Primary | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| List the objects in scope | `arc-1` `SAPRead type=DEVC` (package) or `SAPSearch` | ask the user for the object list |
| Read each object's source | `arc-1` `SAPRead` | ask the user to paste it |
| Decide whether a consumed SAP API is released | `arc-1` `SAPRead type=API_STATE` â€” the authoritative C0â€“C4 contract state | ATC evidence below, else flag as *unverified* |
| Corroborate with tool findings | `abap-adt` `abap_atc_run` + `abap_atc_get_result`, variant `ABAP_CLOUD_DEVELOPMENT_DEFAULT` | `arc-1` `SAPDiagnose action="atc"` |
| Trace what a custom CDS view sits on | `arc-1` `SAPContext action="deps"` / `action="impact"` | read the source and follow `select from` by hand |

`SAPRead type=API_STATE` replaces guesswork: **never assert that an SAP object is or is not released from memory** â€” check it, or mark the finding *unverified* and say so.

## Inputs

If not provided, ask. Defaults to the narrowest scope.

- An ABAP object name (class, function group, program, include, CDS entity, BDEF)
- A package name
- A transport request â€” check every object in the transport

## What to check

For each object in scope, look for the following. Each maps to a rule in `CLAUDE.md`.

### Hard violations â€” never allowed in either BTP or S/4HANA on-prem Cloud development

| Check                                                | Source rule                              |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Use of an SAP class/interface/FM with no C1 release  | `released-apis-only`                     |
| Direct `SELECT` from a SAP-owned database table      | `no-direct-select-on-sap-owned-tables`   |
| Classic dynpro (`CALL SCREEN`, screen exits)         | `abap-cloud-language-scope-only`         |
| `SUBMIT`, `CALL TRANSACTION`, `LEAVE TO`             | `abap-cloud-language-scope-only`         |
| `FORM` / `PERFORM`                                   | `abap-cloud-language-scope-only`         |
| `CALL FUNCTION ... DESTINATION 'NONE'` for internal logic | `abap-cloud-language-scope-only`    |
| Modification of SAP standard objects                  | `no-modification-of-sap-standard`        |
| Use of an SAP enhancement point that is not released | `no-modification-of-sap-standard`        |
| `define view` (legacy DDL view) instead of `define view entity` | `interface-entity-required-annotations` |

### Soft warnings â€” allowed in S/4HANA on-prem Cloud development for transitional reasons, never allowed in BTP

| Check                                                | Note                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Use of a SAP API released only with `Use System-Internally` contract | Allowed on-prem during migration, hard-blocked on BTP |
| Released-API use that is deprecated and slated for removal | Will become a hard violation in a future release |
| Custom CDS view selecting from another *unreleased* custom view | Allowed today, but introduces a chain that will break |

## Procedure

1. **Get the source.** Resolve the scope and read every object per the tool-routing table above. The official `abap-adt` server has no source-read tool, so this step runs on `arc-1` `SAPRead`; if `arc-1` is not connected, ask the user to paste the source from ADT. Do not paraphrase or imagine source code.
2. **For each object, walk the hard checks.** Record every hit with: object, line/element, check name, root-cause rule, and a concrete remediation.
3. **Then walk the soft checks** for objects targeting S/4HANA on-prem. Skip soft checks if the target is BTP â€” every soft finding is hard there.
4. **For every finding, propose a concrete fix.** Examples:
   - Direct `SELECT vbak` â†’ "use released `I_SalesOrder`; field `VBELN` becomes `SalesOrder`, `NETWR` becomes `TotalNetAmount`"
   - Unreleased FM call â†’ "use released class `<X>` instead; signature: `<methods>`"
   - `define view ZX_...` â†’ "migrate to `define view entity ZX_...`; remove `@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName`"
   - `PERFORM process_order` â†’ "move logic to a method on a `FINAL` class; declare per Clean ABAP `methods-do-one-thing-and-stay-small`"
5. **Do not write changes.** This command is read-only. The user runs `/abap-cloud-rap:atc-remediation` or fixes by hand.

## Output format

```
# Clean Core Compliance Report â€” <SCOPE>

Target system: BTP | S/4HANA on-prem
Objects audited: <N>
Hard violations: <N>
Soft warnings: <N>

## Hard violations
(Listed by object, then by check.)

### Object: <name>
#### HV-001 â€” <one-line violation>
- **Where:** <file> line <N>
- **Check:** <check name from the hard table above>
- **Rule:** <rule-name from CLAUDE.md>
- **Found:**
` ` `abap
<offending code>
` ` `
- **Fix:**
` ` `abap
<concrete replacement, ready to paste>
` ` `
- **Notes:** <e.g. field-name mapping when migrating from a table to a released CDS view>

(repeat per finding)

## Soft warnings (S/4HANA on-prem only)
(Same structure as hard violations; only emitted when target is S/4HANA on-prem.)

## Summary
| Object                | Hard | Soft | Clean core compliant? |
|-----------------------|------|------|-----------------------|
| <name>                | N    | N    | yes / no              |
...

## Recommended next actions
1. Fix the hard violations first â€” they prevent activation on BTP.
2. For ATC-checkable findings, run `/abap-cloud-rap:atc-remediation` to apply mechanical fixes in batches.
3. For semantic migrations (e.g. `vbak â†’ I_SalesOrder` with field renames), do them by hand and re-run this command to confirm.
4. Re-run this command after fixes to confirm.
```

## Hard rules for this command

- **Read-only.** No writes back. Ever. Only read/diagnose tools from either server.
- **Always state the target system.** Hard vs soft violation depends on it.
- **Verify release state, never recall it.** A `released-apis-only` finding must cite `SAPRead type=API_STATE` output or an ATC finding. Otherwise mark it *unverified*.
- **Always cite the check name and the source rule.** Never present a finding without both.
- **Always show a concrete remediation.** A finding without a fix is not useful.
- **For field-name migrations (e.g. `vbak.vbeln â†’ I_SalesOrder.SalesOrder`), list every renamed field used in the surrounding code** â€” not just the table swap. Half a migration is worse than none.
- **Pseudo-comment suppression is not a remediation.** If the user wants to ignore a finding, they should justify it through `/abap-cloud-rap:atc-remediation`, not here.
- **Do not include findings that have no rule in `CLAUDE.md`.** This is a compliance check against the library, not a free-form code review.
